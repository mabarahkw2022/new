<b>The Commandment Word<b><br>
Our fathers and grandfathers worked and struggled with all their might to establish for us a free and dignified homeland in which we live in safety and security. Throughout their lives, they were cooperating, understanding, working as one for one goal, which is to serve Kuwait and its people. Thus, they laid a solid foundation for us and wrote a deeply rooted policy for us, which is to always and forever be cooperating and understanding, working as one family, and putting the interest of Kuwait and its people above any other consideration.
In this spirit, we, the children of this generation, follow in the footsteps of our fathers and grandfathers, to push Kuwait forward towards new horizons of advancement and progress in all fields.
